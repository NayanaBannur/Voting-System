# Voting System

This project is a voting system for school student council elections. 

The system allows nomination to various student council posts. The nominations are then compiled and for each post, the top three candidates are selected from amongst the nominees. Nominations are followed by voting and the results of voting are displayed.

The system provides different modes of access for admin, teachers and students. An admin can oversee the entire procedure of elections, a teacher has the power to nominate and vote, and a student can only vote.
